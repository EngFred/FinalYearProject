# FracDetect - AI-Powered Bone Fracture Detection  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
FracDetect is an **AI-powered Android application** that detects bone fractures from **X-ray images** using **TensorFlow Lite object detection models**. The app can analyze X-rays from the **device gallery** or **captured using a camera**, and it draws **bounding boxes** around potential fractures with confidence scores. After detection, users can **generate a medical report**, which can be saved in the **device's documents or downloads folder** and shared with other apps.

## âœ¨ Features
âœ… **AI-Powered Fracture Detection** - Uses three **TFLite models** for accurate results.  
âœ… **X-ray Image Input** - Choose images from the **gallery** or capture with the **camera**.  
âœ… **Bounding Boxes** - Highlights possible fracture areas with confidence scores.  
âœ… **Medical Report Generation** - Automatically generates a detailed report after detection.  
âœ… **Save & Share Reports** - Reports are stored in the **device's documents or downloads folder** and can be **shared** via other apps.
